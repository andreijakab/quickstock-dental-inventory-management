This repo contains a dental inventory management software I co-wrote with my dad and in collaboration with a dentist. It features an easy-to-use interface paired with robust functionality making ordering dental supplies a breeze.

Brief overview of the built-in functions:
* Inventory: tracking and managing of dental supplies
* Quote: generate request for quotes (RFQs) and compare resulting quotes
* Order: create, send, and track orders
* Receive: easily record what supplies have arrived and where they're stored

The application is written in C# using Windows Forms and it communicates with a back-end Access database using SQL.
